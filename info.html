                   <div>
    <p>Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause symptoms ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses, i.e. the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The new coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that had not yet been identified in humans.</p> 
<p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the latest discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>COVID-19 infection remains mild in 80% of cases. In order to delay spreading among the general population and to protect vulnerable and fragile groups in the population, it is important to take a certain number of precautions.</p>

                    What is a pandemic?
                </summary>
                   <div>
    <p>There is no universally applicable definition. However, it can be said that a pandemic is the increased and sustained propagation of an extraordinary infectious human disease that rapidly affects all parts of the world and a large part of the global population.</p> 
<p>On 11 March, the global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

                    How is COVID-19 coronavirus spread?
                </summary>
                   <div>
    <p>The COVID-19 infection is transmitted by people carrying the virus. The disease can be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets expelled from the nose or mouth when a person coughs or sneezes.</p> 
<p>These droplets can persist for some time on objects or surfaces around the person in question. An infection with COVID-19 can occur if you touch these objects or surfaces and then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. COVID-19 can also be contracted by inhaling droplets from a sick person who has just coughed or sneezed. This is why it is important to keep a distance of more than two meters from a sick person and to respect basic hygiene measures.</p> 
<p><strong>Is COVID-19 transmissible during sexual intercourse?</strong></p> 
<p>COVID-19 is not a sexually transmitted disease. However, the virus being present in the respiratory secretions and being able to be transmitted by direct contact of person to person, sexual intercourse is favorable to a transmission of the virus, if one of the partners is infected.</p> 
<p><strong>Can pets transmit COVID-19?</strong></p> 
<p>At this time, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus.</p> 
<p>However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against a variety of common bacteria such as <em>E.coli&nbsp; </em>and <em>Salmonella</em> that can pass from pets to humans.</p> 
<p>According to the World Health Organization, the subsequent predominant route of transmission is human-to-human.</p> 
<p>Because animals and humans can sometimes share diseases, people with COVID-19 should avoid close contact with their pets. Whenever possible, leave them with family and friends for the duration of the illness.</p>

    <p>As more and more cases have appeared in Europe and Luxembourg and as it has become clear that it is impossible to keep the virus from spreading throughout the general population, the control strategy has been adapted. The strategy does not rely on formal preventive quarantine measures anymore, but instead focuses on isolation, auto-isolation and auto-quarantine. From now on, the accent lies on the protection of fragile populations at risk of severe complications.</p>

    <p>Most of the time, the&nbsp;COVID-19 is not more severe for children.

<p>However, it cannot be ruled out that a child may have a severe form of COVID-19; in case of doubt, medical advice will help to establish the diagnosis and to determine the course of treatment.</p>

<p>To this day, the coronavirus has not been associated with fetal anomalies or a heightened risk of a premature birth.</p>

    <p>Since the beginning of the crisis, the coronavirus has been accompanied by another curse with sometimes fatal effects: fake news on social networks. Thus, in March, several hundred people died in Iran after ingesting methanol, believing that they could protect themselves against COVID-19. The consumption of volcanic ash, cocaine or bleach are other examples of false recommendations that endanger those who believe in them.</p>

    <p>The pollen season has begun causing allergies that affect between fifteen and twenty percent of the population. Symptoms can be similar to those caused by a COVID-19 infection, especially for people with allergies who experience asthma and respiratory disorders.</p> 
<p>A person with chronic asthma is usually very familiar with the symptoms of his disease and can easily differentiate these symptoms from those of a COVID-19 infection. Asthma attacks are usually not accompanied by fever, although it occurs in 80 per cent of cases of COVID-19. Respiratory disorders from asthma occur in time-limited asthmatic attacks and are marked by fairly typical wheezing. Respiratory troubles caused by COVID-19 are progressive and permanent over the day and are accompanied by dry coughing.</p>

    <p>Self-monitoring lasts 14 days and applies to people who are likely to have been infected with the virus through contact with a sick person.&nbsp; The purpose of self-monitoring is to detect symptoms of infection as soon as they appear.&nbsp; The person under self-monitoring measures his or her temperature twice a day and makes sure there are no breathing problems or coughing. During self-monitoring, normal activities can be continued.</p>

                   <div>
    <p>There is no specific treatment at this time, although research is ongoing. The treatment is therefore mainly symptomatic, i.e. it is similar to the treatment for a cough, respiratory problems or high temperature.</p> 
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that no medications, including antibiotics, should be self-medicated to prevent or cure COVID-19.</p> 
<p>Some specific treatments are being studied and will be tested in clinical trials. Thus, Luxembourg is taking part in the European trial called "Discovery", launched in six countries to test four treatments. The WHO is also due to launch a large international clinical trial.</p> 
<p>There is currently no scientific evidence linking ibuprofen to the aggravation of COVID-19 infection.</p>

                   <div>
    <p>Formal proof of their efficacy has not yet been demonstrated, neither in the treatment nor in the prevention of COVID-19 disease. Numerous clinical trials are underway to generate robust data to determine the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19.</p> 
<p>Their use for COVID-19, outside of existing authorisations, carries significant risks and requires close monitoring.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Do not take these medicines on your own.</li> 
 <li>Talk to your physician or pharmacist if you have any questions about the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or any other medicines.</li> 
 <li>Use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine only on prescription and under the supervision of a physician.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The Ministry of Health also draws attention to the fact that many falsified medicines against COVID-19 are circulating through the illegal internet shopping channel. Obtaining medicines through this channel carries major risks and is prohibited.</p>

                    What is the gradual exit strategy from confinement?
                </summary>
                   <div>
    <p>The Government's objective is to implement a gradual exit from confinement in phases while remaining cautious to avoid the onset of a second wave of the epidemic. Thus, construction sites and recycling centres, e.g., resumed their activities from 20 April&nbsp; 2020. Schools will open their doors in stages from May onwards.: <a href="https://menej.gouvernement.lu/en/actualites.gouvernement%2Ben%2Bactualites%2Btoutes_actualites%2Barticles%2B2020%2B04-avril%2B16-meisch-reprise-cours.html" target="_blank" title="Ministry of Education, Children and Youth - New window">Ministry of Education, Children and Youth</a>.</p> 
<p>To enable this gradual opening, it is essential to</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>guarantee, at all times, the necessary hospital capacities,</li> 
 <li>maintain the possibility of reintroducing stricter measures in the event of a strong resurgence of the virus among the population,</li> 
 <li>provide close monitoring of the evolution of the pandemic throughout the transition period out of confinement,</li> 
 <li>ensure testing capacities and to support research in particular with regard to tests measuring the acquired immunity of the population.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In general, this means that all members of society must absolutely continue to</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>apply the basic barrier gestures and support them with other specific measures to&nbsp; reduce as far as possible the risk of uncontrolled spread of the virus - including in the workplace,</li> 
 <li>protect vulnerable people in particular.</li>

                    Why has the government decided to limit or forbid certain activities, visits, events and others?
                </summary>
                   <div>
    <p>Taking into account the evolution of the coronavirus COVID-19 in our neighbouring<br> countries and on the national territory, it is necessary to take additional<br> measures to limit the spread of the virus in the population and to protect<br> those at risk. It has also become necessary to adapt the organisation of the health care system in order to cope with an increase in the number of people infected with the virus. The proposed measures take into account the pathogenic and contagious nature of the COVID-19 virus. In this context, the respect of appropriate distance rules in interpersonal relations is one of the most effective measures to limit the spread of the virus.</p> 
<p>The situation also changed at the international level. As of 11 March, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has qualified the COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Moreover, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published an updated risk assessment on March 12, underlining the 'necessity of an immediate targeted action' in order to dampen the impact of the pandemic. According to this appreciation, the risk of severe complications for elderly people and people with a chronic condition is high.</p> 
<p>On 17 March, the Governement has declared <a href="http://www.legilux.lu/eli/etat/leg/rgd/2020/04/17/a303/jo" target="_blank" title="the state of crises on the national territory - New window">the state of crises on the national territory</a>.</p>

                   <div>
    <p>Given that many hospitalised people are vulnerable, visits of hospital patients are prohibited until further notice. If a visit has to take place, all of the necessary protective measures must be taken in order to protect the patients.</p> 
<p>The hospital business continuity plan is to be activated.</p> 
<p>Health staff leave can be cancelled, if necessary.</p> 
<p>Hospitals will deploy their staff mainly to urgent and acute activities.&nbsp; In order to reduce the risk of the virus circulating in hospitals, medical, surgical and care activities which are not short-term indispensable are cancelled. Patients with COVID-19 who do not show severe complications (cases with light symptoms) will be cared for at home, while respecting the recommended isolation measures.</p>

    <p>Our hospitals are prepared. A referral service, namely the National Service of Infectious Diseases at the CHL, is in charge of the reception of patients infected with the coronavirus. If the epidemic spreads, other hospitals are also ready to receive patients infected with COVID-19.</p>

                   <div>
    <p>Establishments receiving the public, activities of a cultural, social, festive, sporting and recreational nature are suspended. Playgrounds are closed.</p> 
<p>As a general rule, the gathering of people on public roads is not permitted. Individuals may pursue outdoor leisure activities as long as they remain alone. Otherwise, they must respect the requirement of a distance of two metres between people.</p> 
<p>A group of people living under the same roof can also pursue outdoor leisure activities. These people in the same household do not need to distance themselves from each other. Thus, parents and children can e.g. walk around holding hands, parents can carry their child across the street. On the other hand, they must all respect the two-metre distance from people who do not live with them.</p> 
<p>When parents are separated and have visitation and accommodation rights and alternate custody of their children, they are not bound by the travel restrictions for the public. This applies to the duration of trips from one household to another.</p> 
<p>Owners of pets, e.g. cats, dogs, horses, can travel to ensure their well-being. Thus, when these animals are not at home, they can go to the premises to take care of them. However, here again, no gathering of people is allowed, the distance of at least 2 metres must be respected.</p> 
<p>Establishments in the cultural, recreational and sports sectors, as well as restaurants and cafés, are closed. The same applies to company canteens, except where an interpersonal distance of two metres is respected.</p> 
<p>The prohibition does not apply to take-away, drive-in and home delivery services.</p> 
<p>The prohibition does not apply to hotels. However, hotel restaurants and bars, with the exception of room service and take-out, are closed</p>
