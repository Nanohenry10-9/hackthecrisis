                <p>It is important to note that any resumption of activities will be accompanied by very strict barrier gestures and complemented by the <b>mandatory wearing of a mask </b> or any other device that covers the nose and mouth for interpersonal contact situations if the safety distance of <b>2 metres cannot be guaranteed.</b>

                <h1>Deconfinement strategy in phases</h1>
                <h2><b>Phase 1</b> - Reopening of construction sites (tentative date <u>20 April 2020</u>)</h2>
                <p>The first phase thus covers the following activities:

</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reopening of construction sites; 
</li>
                    <li>Educational aid and assistance activities (Services in child and family aid, Competence centres in special psycho-pedagogical care and measures to benefit children who are on the verge of dropping out of school);
</li>
                    <li>Activities of gardeners and landscapers; 
</li>
                    <li>Businesses whose main activity is do-it-yourself;
</li>
                    <li>Reopening of recycling centres.
</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This list will be completed on 4 May by the resumption of senior classes, as well as internships and practical work at BTS and university level.

</p>
                <h2><b>Phase 2</b> - resumption of secondary education (tentative date <u>11 May 2020</u>)</h2>
                <h2><b>Phase 3</b> - resumption of fundamental education as well as the reopening of cr√®ches and childcare facilities (tentative date <u>25 May 2020</u>)</h2>
                <p>This will be followed - in later phases - by the resumption of commercial activities and the reopening of the HORECA sector. At this stage, however, it is premature to give a detailed assessment of the lifting of restrictions in this sector. A final decision will be taken in due course by the Government Council on the basis of an analysis of the situation.

</p>
                <p>Companies, businesses and administrations are generally encouraged to continue to promote teleworking throughout the transition period out of confinement. 

</p>
                <p>Gatherings will remain prohibited until <b>31 July</b>, except for <u>funerals and civil weddings</u>, which will be allowed for a <u>maximum of 20 people</u> and provided that an interpersonal distance of <u>2 metres</u> is respected. The prohibitions laid down in Article 2 of the amended Grand Ducal Regulation of 18 March introducing a series of measures in the context of the fight against COVID-19 will be maintained.

</p>
                <p>The confinement measures currently in place for vulnerable persons and persons over 65 years of age will continue to be in force at least<b> until the end of the first phase</b>. The gradual lifting of the current restrictions also entails the need to develop, in consultation with the Ministry of Family Affairs, Integration and the Greater Region a strategy for the protection of vulnerable persons in care centres and persons over 65 years of age. 

</p>
                <p>Workers belonging to the vulnerable category may consult their doctor to determine whether the severity of the illness prevents them from going to work. This assessment must be done on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the recommendations of the Health Directorate and the working environment of the person concerned.
